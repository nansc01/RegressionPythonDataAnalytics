# RegressionPythonDataAnalytics
predicting changing house prices using changes in rent, DJI, mortgage rate- Rsq 54%
# P values - greater than .1 means not useful and is zero / change sign

# R-sq is over 50%, which means that model is not that bad
# P value for rent is 58% which means that this factor is not relevant
# P value of DJI is 15% so it is useful (but not the best)
# P value of Morg is 0% which is the most important factor in the model
